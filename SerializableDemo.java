    Serializable is a marker interface (has no data member and method). 
    It is used to "mark" Java classes so that objects of these classes may get the certain capability.
    The Cloneable and Remote are also marker interfaces.
    It must be implemented by the class whose object you want to persist. 
    The String class and all the wrapper classes implement the java.io.Serializable interface by default.
